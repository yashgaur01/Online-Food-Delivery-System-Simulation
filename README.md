# Online Food Delivery System Simulation

## Overview

The Online Food Delivery System Simulation project simulates the process of managing food deliveries in a city using various algorithms, including Dijkstra's and A*. It provides a platform to handle orders, customers, and restaurants, showcasing how deliveries can be efficiently managed in a real-world scenario.

## Features

- Graph-based representation of the city
- Ability to add customers, restaurants, and orders
- Order processing using Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Order processing using A* Algorithm
- Customizable delivery times and routes

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (g++, clang++)
- C++11 standard support

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yashgaur01/Online-Food-Delivery-System-Simulation.git
   cd Online-Food-Delivery-System-Simulation
